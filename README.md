# Giga Booster Packs

Inspired by an idea that a friend had. You can merge two Mega Booster Packs of the same type into two.

Install this as you would a normal mod!

All iconography is based on modified Balatro assets, except for one of the Giga Buffoon Packs which is based on the Gigachad Blueprint from https://github.com/r0maps/GigaJokers.
